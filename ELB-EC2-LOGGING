ELB Logging:

Access logs give detaied information about requests send to the load balancer, : 
Time the request was recived, the client IP address, Request paths, Server resopnses, Latencies.

--> Logs are turned off by default.
--> Once turned on, Logs are stored in bucket on S3 of your choice.
--> Logs can be taken in intervals of 5min or 60 min.
--> Log format: Can view logs, id, region, loadbalancing, year, month, aws-account-id,ipaddress,log.

ELB Logging Format:

End-time--> Data and time that the logging interval ended.
ip-address --> the lload balancer node that handled the request.
random-string--> System-generated random string.

What kind of data can we get from the log files of ELB ? why it is so Important ?

Timestamp --> Time when the load balancer received the request from the client.
Client:port --> IP Address and port of the requesting client.
Backend:port --> IP address and port of the instance that processed the request.

request_processing_time:

HTTP: --> total time it took from when the load balancer received the request until it sent the request to an instance.
TCP: --> Total time from when the load balancer accepted a TCP/SSL Connection from a client to when it sent the first byte of data to an instance.

Bacend_processing_time:

HTTP: --> tOTAL TIime from when the load balancer sends a request to an instance, until the instance starts to send a response to the load balancer.
TCP --> Total time for the load balancer to establish a connection to an instance.

Response_processing_time:

HTTP --> tOTAL TIME From when the load balancer received a response header from a backend instance, until it started to send a response to the client.
TCP --> Total time when a load balancer received the first byte from the instane, to when it started sending a response to the client.

Request-includes:

--> The method like GET, PUT, POST, ETC ,,.
--> The protocal like HTTP.
--> The host header and port like www.example.com:80
--> path is added to the host like /index.html
--> Protocol version like HTTP 1.1 or 2.0 

--> User_agent-Tells us which client the request came from.

How to use this logging data?

we could use thousands or millions of record in our log files, so what can we do with this infromation ?

Process the data with Amazon EMR or third party tools, Feed the data into those tools and receive data back out.

We can also Monitoring API Calls with Cloud trail:

Instead of logging client requests, cloud trail logs APICalls made against services. These logs are stored in the JSON Format and give information like: API ACtion, data and time of the request, request parameters and the response.
